Mabuhay!

Welcome to Tahanan Candle Co., where I invite you to embark on an olfactory journey through the vibrant landscapes, rich traditions, and diverse culture of the Philippines. My scented candles are more than just a collection of fragrances; they're a homage to the beauty and spirit of the archipelago.

Our Inspiration: At Tahanan Candle Co, I am driven by a deep love for the Philippines and a passion for capturing its essence in every candle we create. Each scent is carefully curated to transport you to the heart of the country, evoking memories of bustling markets, serene beaches, and the warm embrace of its people.

Crafted with Care: My scented candles are handcrafted with meticulous attention to detail. I use a blend of premium soy wax and high-quality fragrance oils to ensure a clean burn and an immersive aromatic experience. Every aspect, from wick to wax, is thoughtfully chosen to align with my commitment to quality and authenticity.

A Fragrance for Every Story: I've carefully curated scents that mirror the diverse landscapes of the Philippines. Whether you're longing for the tropical sweetness of ripe mangoes to the soothing notes of pandan leaves, the delicate elegance of sampaguita blossoms, or the comforting warmth of coconut palms, I have a fragrance that resonates with your unique journey.

Pure Ingredients: I use only premium, sustainably sourced soy wax, natural cotton wicks, and phthalate-free fragrance oils in our candles. My ingredients are chosen with care to ensure a clean and safe burning experience.

Sustainability Matters: I am committed to sustainability and environmental responsibility. Our packaging is designed with both beauty and eco-consciousness in mind, reflecting our dedication to the well-being of our planet. 

Responsible Sourcing: I am dedicated to responsible sourcing. Our soy wax is sustainably harvested, and I work with suppliers who share my commitment to ethical and eco-friendly practices.

Reusable Containers: Many of my candle containers are designed to be reusable. After your candle has burned its last light, repurpose the container for other uses, reducing waste and promoting sustainability.

My Promise to You: By choosing my candles, you are not only enhancing your living space but also contributing to a more sustainable future.I am dedicated to providing you with candles that bring warmth, comfort, and light while minimizing their impact on the planet.

Ignite Your Memories: Ignite a "Tahanan" candle and allow the scents to carry you across the islands, from the bustling streets of Manila to the tranquil shores of Palawan. Let each aroma be a reminder of the moments, experiences, and stories that make the Philippines a place like no other.

Thank you for joining us on this aromatic voyage. I am delighted to share the Philippines with you, one scent at a time.
